# Romreservasjon

Application to reserve rooms

## Quick guide for login and creating users

We recommend admin login when logging in for the first time.
- Email: admin@admin.no
- Password: admin123

- Check out the NavBar and you will spot "Lag bruker" menu option.
- This menu option redirects you to page for adding accounts which are NOT admin.
- If you want to make another admin account, you will have to update an already created account in the database
- Password is auto generated, but you can also use a custom password.
- We got this idea of auto generated passwords from Qs (the first version), among others.

## Future Possibilites

Even though we are satisfied with the result, there are still many things we would want to add in the future if we had the time.

We focused on the main functionality which was the room reservation, user and admin system. However, we also managed to add the bare bones of equipment reservation system which was alternative extension 1 and a fully functioning chat on each section which was a part of extension 2. We are also very satisfied with the quick loading and responsiveness on our website. Now to the future possibilities:

* Expand the chat system s√• you can see all chats for each room, not only in each section of a room.
* Make the equipment reservation system more complete by letting admin edit and administrate these type reservations.
* Let the administrative users upload a json file when creating users so they can create multiple users at a time.
* A group system which could represent for example a class.
* Dark and light mode with different color combinations.
* Front end testing
