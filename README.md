## Quick guide for login and creating users

We recommend admin login when logging in for the first time.
- Email: admin@admin.no
- Password: admin123
<br/>
- Check out the NavBar and you will spot "Lag bruker" menu option.
- This menu option redirects you to page for adding accounts which are NOT admin.
- If you want to make another admin account, you will have to update an already created account in the database
- Password is auto generated, but you can also use a custom password.
- We got this idea of auto generated passwords from Qs (the first version), among others.
